![Alt text](/Images/Bubbles%20Theme.PNG)

# Description
Project is a todo list that allows users to input tasks based on their choice of priority. With the "pick" feature, a task from each list is randomly picked and displayed in the "Let's Start With:" section. As users complete items on the list, new tasks can be randomly chosen.

There are two themes: Bubbles and Night
Checkboxes are filled with corresponding colors along with the "High Priority" exclaim symbol, line, and "pick" button.




# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap


# Issues
Sometimes when items from the Low Priority list are deleted before High Priority, the next LP task will not show up after the "pick" button is clicked.
